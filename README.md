# Bridge
A data processing pipeline to evaluate the data extracted from MockNet

## Features
- **Data Processing** - Bridge is able to validate and process the log results obtained from [MockNet framework](https://github.com/project-crewmen/mocknet).
- **Scheduling Algorithm Evaluation** - Bridge natively support for implementing different types of scheduling algorithms.
- **Synthetic Data Generation** - For quick evaluation of scheduling algorithms, Bridge is able to general synthetic microservive log results. This enables reearchers to quick evaluations of their implementations.
- **Visualization** - Generate Barplots, Pieplots and Lineplots to visualize the experiment results on real-time
